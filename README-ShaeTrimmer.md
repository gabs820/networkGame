My contributions to the project include:
  -Researching how games in Java are created
  -Creating the player movement for the game (originally MoveBall.java and MyKeyListener.java)
  -Assisting in getting the clients/server connected together
  -Adding the code to ensure that the game would not start until at least two clients were connected
  -Adding code to transfer the starting player position to the server, and then to each client
  -Moving the code from MoveBall.java into MassChaosClient.java
  -Removing old .java files we no longer were going to use
